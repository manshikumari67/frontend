                         Water scarcity is a critical global issue that occurs when the demand for water exceeds the available supply in a given region. It can result from both physical scarcity (where there is not enough water to meet the needs of people) and economic scarcity (where financial or infrastructural barriers prevent access to water, even if it's locally available). There are various factors contributing to water scarcity.

                         Water scarcity is a pressing global challenge affecting billions of people, ecosystems, and economies. Understanding its causes, impacts, and solutions requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses natural, social, and economic dimensions. Rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrial expansion have intensified the demand for water resources, while climate change has disrupted hydrological cycles, leading to prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall patterns.

            <h1 className="text-center text-2xl sm:text-1xl py-10 font-medium">Water scarcity profoundly impacts bird populations by disrupting their habitats and food sources. The drying up of wetlands and water bodies deprives birds of essential nesting, feeding, and breeding grounds, while the decline in aquatic life reduces their food availability. Migration routes are disrupted as stopover points vanish, increasing energy demands and mortality. Birds face dehydration, heat stress, and intensified competition at limited water sources, making them more vulnerable to predation. </h1>

          Even in countries with adequate water resources, water scarcity is not uncommon. 
          Although this may be due to a number of factors â€” collapsed infrastructure and distribution systems, 
          contamination, conflict, or poor management of water resources â€” it is clear that climate change, as well as human factors, 
          are increasingly denying children their right to safe water and sanitation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-lg text-justify text-gray-700">
          Water scarcity limits access to safe water for drinking and for practicing basic hygiene at home, in schools, 
          and in healthcare facilities. When water is scarce, sewage systems can fail and the threat of contracting diseases like cholera surges. 
          Scarce water also becomes more expensive.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-lg text-justify text-gray-700">
          Water scarcity takes a greater toll on women and children because they are often the ones responsible for collecting it. 
          When water is further away, it requires more time to collect, which often means less time at school. 
          Particularly for girls, a shortage of water in schools impacts student enrolment, attendance, and performance. 
          Carrying water long distances is also an enormous physical burden and can expose children to safety risks and exploitation.

          As the factors driving water scarcity are complex and vary widely across countries and regions, UNICEF works at multiple levels

        <ul className="list-inside list-decimal pl-8 text-lg text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Identifying new water resources:</strong> We assess the availability of water resources using various technologies, including remote sensing and geophysical surveys and field investigations.</li>
          <li><strong>Improving the efficiency of water resources:</strong> We rehabilitate urban water distribution networks and treatment systems to reduce water leakage and contamination, promoting wastewater reuse for agriculture to protect groundwater.</li>
          <li><strong>Planning for urban scarcity:</strong> We plan for future water needs by identifying available resources to reduce the risk of cities running out of water.</li>
          <li><strong>Expanding technologies to ensure climate resilience:</strong> We support and develop climate-resilient water sources, including the use of deeper groundwater reserves through solar-powered water networks. We also advance water storage through small-scale retention structures, managed aquifer recharge (where water is pumped into underground reserves to improve its quality), and rainwater harvesting.</li>
          <li><strong>Changing behaviors:</strong> We work with schools and communities to promote an understanding of the value of water and the importance of its protection, including by supporting environmental clubs in schools.</li>
          <li><strong>Planning national water needs:</strong> We work with key stakeholders at national and sub-national levels to understand the water requirements for domestic use and for health and sanitation, and advocate to ensure that this is reflected in national planning considerations.</li>
          <li><strong>Supporting the WASH sector:</strong> We develop technical guidance, manuals, and online training programmes for WASH practitioners to improve standards for water access.</li>
